# Storefront API (Legacy V1)
A partial OpenAPI (2.0) specification of the <a href="https://textus.com/api/">Textus API<a> with normalization for integration into platforms such as ScribeSoft.

The object definitions for the other endpoints (`Broadcast`, ...) are available, but you will need to implement the actual endpoints using these should you require the speciication for these.

This document may be converted to OpenAPI 3.0, but you will lose the ability to integrate into more restrictive platforms that do not yet support this version of the OpenAPI initiative.
